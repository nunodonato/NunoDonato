### Hi! I’m Nuno Donato 👋
A chronic developer born and living in Portugal.

I started coding with QBasic when I was 7, and since then it has been part of my life. I’ve done simple apps, complex apps, full-stack development on the web (Laravel ❤), designed databases, developed games and love to imagine and create small tools. I’m currently working as a freelancer and available for contract work.

You can find my blog and a portfolio (kind of) at https://www.nunodonato.com
